a random try out of 27 bits iterations that xors the 16 values of 4 bits of a 8 bytes block and then
comes to codify over the 0 and ones bits into a sequence to give a overall of compression on the all 8 bytes to entrophy of 7.98 bytes
a random seed of 27 bits stored is already included

# explendid
# imploder

not too much too explain
a coder in blitz max basic to compress to 99,5 % or 7.98 entrophy
in order to compress any file to a minimum filesize of 10K after several recompressions of toi recursive file.
reverse engine to be done but it may be acheivable with help.
its Highly slow compression due it needs to compute for 8 bytes more than 128Million  instructions but goes like the compression of the any file in 50kb per 3 days one thread.
