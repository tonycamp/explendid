a random try out of 26 bits iterations that xors the 32 values of 4 bits of a 16 bytes block and then
comes to codify over the 0 and ones bits into a sequence to give a overall of compression on the all 8 bytes to entrophy of 8.98 bytes
a random seed of 26 bits stored is already included

# explendid
# imploder

not too much too explain
a coder in blitz max basic to compress to 111 % or 8.98 entrophy
in order to compress any file to a minimum filesize of 10K after several recompressions of toi and other compressors recursive file.
reverse engine to be done but it may be acheivable with help.
its Highly slow compression due it needs to compute for 16 bytes more than 64 Million instructions but goes like the compression of the any file in 150 kb per 2 hours one thread.
