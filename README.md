a random try out of 24 bits iterations that xors the 32 values of 4 bits of a 16 bytes block and then
comes to codify over the 4th bit the one that gives  8 or 0 in the 0 to 15 value and if its just one bit to one over the all 32 it stores on aa 5 bits instead of 32 bits and gives space for  the 24 bits seed
overall of compression on the all 16 bytes to entrophy of 7.98 bytes or 98%

# explendid
# imploder

not too much too explain
a coder in blitz max basic to compress to 98 % or 7.95 entrophy
in order to compress any file to a minimum filesize of 10K after several recompressions of toi and other compressors recursive file.
reverse engine to be done but it may be acheivable with help.
its Highly slow compression due it needs to compute for 16 bytes more than 16 Million random instructions but goes like the compression of the any file in 150 kb per 4 hours one thread.
