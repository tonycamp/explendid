a random try out of 65536 iteration that xors the 16 values of 4 bits of a block and then
comes to codify over the 0 and 0nes bits int sequence to give a overall of compression on the all 8 bytes to 7 bytes
random seed of 2 bytes already included
# explendid

not too much too explain
a coder in blitz max basic to compress to 91 % or 7.20 entropy
in order to compress any file to a minimum filesize of 10K of toi file after severeal recursive compressions
reverse engine to be done but it may be acheivable with help
its not fast compression but goes like the compression of the any file in 1 Mb per 30 mins one thread.
