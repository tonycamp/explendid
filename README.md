not too much too explain
a coder in blitz max basic with the help of to compress to 97 % or 7.92 entropy
in order to compress any file
to a minimum filesize of 10K
reverse engine to be done
in the fast version goes like the compression of the any file takes 75kb per 1 min.
since im doing 2000 000 000 bytes to just store a bit over 2000 000 000 bits goes like max
filesize of 2 000 000 000 / 8 = max file size of 250Mb or soo lots to improve.
and i expect that the decompression can be 10x faster since got no need to find the random table of 4096 possibilities cause its already
inserted the seed iteration on the block.. for instances a compression that takes 2 hours for 10Mb..
goes like in 10 mins to restore all the steps of 10Kb into those 10 Mb..
